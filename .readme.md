# 🌍 3D Travel Memory Globe

An interactive 3D web application that allows users to visualize their personal travel history by pinning memories on a rotating digital globe. Users can upload photos, write reflections, and revisit their global experiences in an immersive and artistic format.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design a visually engaging web platform to **record and revisit travel experiences**.
- Implement a **3D interactive globe** to replace traditional map-based travel logs.
- Enable users to **upload multimedia content** (photos, reflections, music).
- Offer privacy and sharing controls to support both **private journaling** and **public memory sharing**.

## 🚀 Key Deliverables

- ✅ 3D globe with interactive zoom and click features *(using CesiumJS or Three.js)*  
- ✅ Memory pins for geolocation-tagged stories with text, images, and sound  
- ✅ User login system (Flask + PostgreSQL)  
- ✅ Memory timeline view  
- ✅ Public/private visibility settings  
- ✅ Deployed application via Heroku or similar  

---

## ⚠️ Special Constraints

- File storage must be handled with care (cloud-based or local for prototype)
- Location and user data require **basic security/authentication**
- 3D globe rendering must be optimized for performance on various devices
- If using third-party APIs (e.g., geolocation, OpenAI), consider rate limits

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

By the end of the project, we aim to deliver a **deployed web app** with:

- Immersive, 3D interactive experience  
- Clean, responsive UI  
- Support for multimedia storytelling  
- Stable backend for user data and uploads  
- Potential for future extensions (collab mode, AI features, etc.)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Three.js or CesiumJS  
- **Backend**: Python Flask  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)  
- **Optional**: Cloudinary/AWS for file uploads, Leaflet.js (alternative map option)
